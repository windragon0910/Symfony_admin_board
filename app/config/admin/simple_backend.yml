# If you just need a quick backend for your Symfony application, this is the
# only configuration you must define in 'app/config/config.yml':
#
# easy_admin:
#     entities:
#         - AppBundle\Entity\Category
#         - AppBundle\Entity\Image
#         - AppBundle\Entity\Purchase
#         - AppBundle\Entity\PurchaseItem
#         - AppBundle\Entity\Product
#
# In this demo application, the configuration is split into several small files
# to show an alternative way to define the configuration for complex backends.
#
# The configuration options are explained in detail in the bundle documentation,
# which is published at https://github.com/javiereguiluz/EasyAdminBundle
