# This file sets the configuration of the 'Purchase' entity.
#
# NOTE: this demo application splits the backend configuration into several
# small files for educational purposes. In your application you can put the
# entire backend configuration in just one file.
#
# The configuration options are explained in detail in the bundle documentation,
# which is published at https://github.com/javiereguiluz/EasyAdminBundle
